How do demographics relate to obesity, exercise and diet habits? How has this changed over time? Are there regional trends we can observe? Both in local culture and changes over time?
This dataset include various demographics in united states and how they relate to obesity, exercise and diet habits.

The projectâ€™s goal is to analyze demographic information and its correlation with obesity in the United States. 

This dataset came from the BRFSS (Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System), which was then used by the CDC's Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity.

THE Demographic variables include the education level, age, ethnicity, gender, and income. These factors are examined to understand their impact on obesity trends.

The data sourced for this project was a large dataset,and we had different categories and questions, it was collected and amended the data based on the questions,specifically related to diet, exercise and obesity.

The data is stratified by age, education, income, gender, and race to offer detailed insights, In addition to the individual stratifications, this dataset also includes an "Overall" value for each state, as well as an Overall value for the entire NAtion. 

we cleaned it to a smaller dataset and we named the DNPAO,the dataset was centered around nutrition, physical activities and obesity.
